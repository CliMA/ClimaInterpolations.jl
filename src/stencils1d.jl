"""
    get_stencil(alg::Linear, xsource, xtarget; first = 1, extrapolate = Flat())

Get the interval in the source grid (`xsource`) in which the target point, `xtarget`, is located.
For linear interpolation, this interval is also the full stencil needed for the interpolation.
The stencil specification is characterized by `[st, en]` where `st` is the starting point and
`en` is the ending point of the stencil in the target grid. This function returns the tuple `(st, en)`.
Linear and Flat extrapolation schemes are supported at the boundaries. The argument `first` can be used
to speedup the search, by providing a more efficient starting point for the search.
